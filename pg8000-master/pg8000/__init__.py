#
# @param user   The username to connect to the PostgreSQL server with.  This
# parameter is required.
#
# @keyparam host   The hostname of the PostgreSQL server to connect with.
# Providing this parameter is necessary for TCP/IP connections.  One of either
# host, or unix_sock, must be provided.
#
# @keyparam unix_sock   The path to the UNIX socket to access the database
# through, for example, '/tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432'.  One of either unix_sock or host
# must be provided.  The port parameter will have no affect if unix_sock is
# provided.
#
# @keyparam port   The TCP/IP port of the PostgreSQL server instance.  This
# parameter defaults to 5432, the registered and common port of PostgreSQL
# TCP/IP servers.
#
# @keyparam database   The name of the database instance to connect with.  This
# parameter is optional, if omitted the PostgreSQL server will assume the
# database name is the same as the username.
#
# @keyparam password   The user password to connect to the server with.  This
# parameter is optional.  If omitted, and the database server requests password
# based authentication, the connection will fail.  On the other hand, if this
# parameter is provided and the database does not request password
# authentication, then the password will not be used.
#
# @keyparam socket_timeout  Socket connect timeout measured in seconds.
# Defaults to 60 seconds.
#
# @keyparam ssl     Use SSL encryption for TCP/IP socket.  Defaults to False.
#
# @return An instance of {@link #ConnectionWrapper ConnectionWrapper}.
